 *
 *  This Quaternion class was designed for use in CS354 Computer Graphics.
 *  This may not be the most efficient way to reinvent the wheel, but I
 *  wanted to understand each and every manipulation as deeply as I could,
 *  and that required writing it in my own style without any use of copy
 *  and paste. Some notes about the implementation:
 *
 *  [Quaternion Representation]
 *
 *  One can visualize a quaternion's components in the formats:
 *
 *        Q = [ X, Y, Z, W ]        or         Q = [ W | X, Y, Z ]
 *
 *  where the former is more similar to a vector in homogeneous coordinates
 *  and the latter is more in line with angle-axis representation. Because
 *  it helps me to think of a quaternion as a physical representation of a
 *  rotation, I've chosen the latter in this code.
 *
 *
 *  [Return Types]
 *
 *  There was an interesting challenge with return types. For instance, the
 *  matrix representation of the quaternion is expected in OpenGL as a float
 *  array. To return an array, I'd have to allocate it to the heap (No! I
 *  don't trust programmers to free it later), pass a pointer to a permanent
 *  local copy (No...it solves the memory leak but opens our class copy to
 *  being tampered with), or return some kind of object that could cast to
 *  a float array.  Luckily, OpenGL technically expects,
 *
 *      "a pointer to 16 consecutive values, which are used as the
 *      elements of a 4x4 column-major matrix,"
 *
 *  which an STL vector certainly satisfies. Thus, all array returns are
 *  passed as copies of an STL vector, leaving memory clean and our
 *  variables safe.
 *
 *
 *  [Vector/vertex Rotation]
 *
 *  It would make sense to overload the operator* to handle the application
 *  of a quaternion to a vector (v' = q*v*q^), but I've chosen to make it
 *  a public function to reinforce the concept of the quaternion being
 *  the mathematical embodiment of a rotation which acts upon vector. This
 *  will work as well for 'concatenated' quaternions. Example:
 *
 *      v2 = (qA * qB * qC).rotate(v1);         // v' = Ra.Rb.Rc.v
 *
 *
 *  [Constructor Overload]
 *
 *  Pun intended. I'm trying to cover all bases for the instantiation of a
 *  quaternion from different representations of rotations and even different
 *  methods of passing array values. When it becomes safe to depend on
 *  constructor delegation (GCC 4.7), I'll refactor for a cleaner class.
 *  I also considered the class template format, but that prohibits the split
 *  of code between a .cpp and a .h file. I'd rather be well-documented and
 *  organized for this learning experience.
 *
 *
 *  [Miscellaneous]
 *
 *  The liberal use of the keyword "this" is a personal style choice for
 *  enforced correctness and clarity.
 *
 *
 *  [Resources]
 *
 *  My four favorite resources for understanding quaternions (in addition
 *  to Wikipedia) are listed below:
 *
 *  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB6U849kwXc

 *  http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/
 *                 OpenGL:Tutorials:Using_Quaternions_to_represent_rotation
 *
 *
 *  If this can become public domain, feel free to alter and optimize as you
 *  see fit, giving credit where credit is due.
