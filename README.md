_Modeling stable electron wave states as a factor of energy (WIP)_

**I am under no illusions and make no claims that this represents accurate physics!**

My goal with this project is to tactically/viscerally understand de Broglie wavelength stuff, inspired by this wonderful youtube video: [https://youtu.be/k581_XpaTnU](https://youtu.be/k581_XpaTnU).

Intended functionality is that, beginning with 0 input energy and 0 electrons, the user will be able to increase input energy and see the electron orbits appear, evolve, and stabilize from the first orbit outwards.

This is still a work in progress as I'm slowly learning Qt and relearning OpenGL after 10 years of only dealing with ML code and corporate scripting. I'll flesh this out more another time.
