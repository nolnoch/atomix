[GENERAL START]
o Resize VBO when/if CloudConfig changes
o Commit to new vertex/resolution scaling or fix above
o Multithreading (ughhh, but very necessary)...[holy crap, I figured it out -- 98% reduction in time!]
o Slider for bg color
o Slider for cutting through model (IBO change)
o Scale pan based on zoom level
o Swap state-lock to make maxRadius depend on config
o Selecting subset of previous recipes does not enable Lock Recipes button
o Redo Wave Config UI with QGridLayout
o Sate-lock WaveManager (Manager) with new BitFlag
o Option to normalize perN, perL, or perALL...[Added coefficient weighting instead]
o New Tolerance + cullRDPs needs to enter in a different place
o Coefficient for orbital recipes
o Replace radio buttons with toggle slider switch
o Debug overlay
o Loading animation for vertex and RDP generation
o Change far distance based on zoom level
o Programmatically limit input on GUI fields
o Add application icon
o Implement Vulkan back-end
o Programmatically ensure that certain config combos are maintained (i.e., superposition -> Parallel & CPU)
o Fix Harmonics Phi culling
o Implement CPU vs GPU cloud rendering -- Note: FULL cpu rendering is not really feasible considering the array of possible superposed states
o Add radial culling
o Implement MainWindow resizeEvent()
o Move ProgressBar to StatusBar
o Re-add negative m_l values and correctly render superpositions
o Save window geometry and state between sessions
o Refactor config files to use denser format, saved to file from application
- Add config saving for harmonics, including selected recipes
- Deployable packages on Ubuntu, Windows, and MacOS [MacOS WIP]
- Reimplement custom vertex shaders through QFileDialog and JIT programVK addition
- Energy tab
- Gravity tab
- Planck tab
