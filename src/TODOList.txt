- Resize VBO when/if CloudConfig changes
- Commit to new vertex/resolution scaling or fix above
- Multithreading (ughhh, but very necessary)
- Model too dark when zoomed; adjust lighting model or option for bright bg
- Energy tab
- Atomic element presets
- Scale pan based on zoom level
- Loading animation for vertex and RDP generation
- Less vertice resolution needed for large models, more for big. Swap state-lock to make former depend on latter?
